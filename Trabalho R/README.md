## HNSCC Gene Expression Analysis

This repository contains code and analysis for studying gene expression patterns associated with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) research network. The project aims to:

1. **Identify Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs):** Analyze TCGA gene expression data to pinpoint genes that are significantly upregulated or downregulated in HNSCC compared to normal tissue.

2. **Enrichment Analysis:** Explore the biological functions and pathways associated with the identified DEGs, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HNSCC progression and pathogenesis.

3. **Predictive Analysis:** Develop machine learning models to predict tissue type (normal or tumoral) based on the expression profiles of DEGs, achieving high accuracy with the Naive Bayes model implemented in R.

4. **Biomarker Discovery:** Highlight key biomarkers such as FOXD2-AS1, which are associated with HNSCC based on their differential expression and functional significance inferred from enrichment analysis results.

This work contributes to our understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms driving HNSCC, potentially informing future research and therapeutic interventions for this disease.
